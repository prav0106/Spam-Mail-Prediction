# üìß Spam Mail Prediction Using Machine Learning and Django

This project is a full-stack **Spam Email Classifier Web App** built using **Django** and a **Logistic Regression ML model**. It allows users to **register, log in**, input email content, and get real-time **spam predictions**, with personal prediction history.

---   
   
## üìÅ Project Overview  

- Built with Django and deployed on **Railway**
- Uses **TF-IDF Vectorizer** and **Logistic Regression**
- User authentication (register, login, logout)
- Predictions and history saved per user
- Clean and responsive UI with Bootstrap 5

---

## üß† Machine Learning Model 

The ML model was trained using `mail_data.csv` with the following steps:

- **Preprocessing**: Lowercasing, stopword removal, tokenization
- **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF Vectorizer
- **Model**: Logistic Regression
- **Evaluation**:
  - Training Accuracy: ~97%
  - Testing Accuracy: ~96%

Final files used in the app:

- `spam_model.pkl`: Saved ML model  
- `vectorizer.pkl`: Saved TF-IDF Vectorizer
